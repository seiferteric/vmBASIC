# vmBASIC

## Intro
vmBASIC is a project to implement a simple 8-bit CPU virtual machine with a built-in BASIC interpreter along with a set of tools to inspect memory, the CPU etc.

## Goals
Ultimately I would like to be able to build and run this just about anywhere. Locally on your computer, whether you run Linux, Mac or Windows, in the Browser using WebAssembly or on your Raspberry PI.
